# IS 601 Spring 2021 FINAL Project - Super Assets - Zach Crossey  & David Preciado

This repository is the final project for NJIT IS 601 Spring 2012 by Zach Crossey & David Preciado. The concept project is a secret superhero & super villain database representing the top 100. Those with access must have a username and password. Registration is possible. Once a user accesses the system, they can see the list of Assets (super villains and superheroes), add Assets, and see aggregated statistical data.

Zach Crossey developed and managed the logger (log in and log out) and registration function, which included user database and email confirmation (Reference "Feature Documentation" below items 1-10 and 15) .

David Preciado developed and managed the statical analysis features using ChartsJs and the booststrap template implementation (Reference "Feature Documentation" below items 11-14).
