# IS 601 Spring 2021 FINAL Project - Super Assets - Zach Crossey  & David Preciado

This repository is the final project for NJIT IS 601 Spring 2012 by Zach Crossey & David Preciado. The concept project is a secret superhero & super villain database representing the top 100. Those with access must have a username and password. Registration is possible. Once a user accesses the system, they can see the list of Assets (super villains and superheroes), add Assets, and see aggregated statistical data.
